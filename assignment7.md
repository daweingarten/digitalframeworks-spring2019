## Assignment 7

<br> I found that Lori Lightfoot, the mayor of Chicago, made 21 federal political contributions during the last election cycle from 2017 to 2018.
To follow up on this story, I would investigate each of the candidates Lightfoot contributed to over the past two decades. I also would interview some of the individuals who she contributed to in order to see what their expectations are for Lightfoot as she begins her term of office and trace the connections between the politicians. This story would likely take two days to report. </br>
<br></br>

<br>In order to find my story, I did the following:
1.	Searched the FEC website for donations in the 2017-2018 election cycle from Lori Lightfoot.
2.	This was after I searched campaign contributions made by players in the starting 5’s for the NBA Finals. There were none. I then moved on to NFL players, Peyton Manning contributed to Jeb Bush, but this had been reported previously. 
3.	Repeated the previous step for previous election cycles going back to 2003. 
4.	For both CSVs, I:
o	took the the committee name column
o	made a pivot table to get the unique number of contributions to each campaign. </br>

### Headline: Lightfoot big contributor to other politicians in the state

<b> Nut graf: </b> Lori Lightfoot just became the mayor of Chicago, but her contributions to politicians in the state stretch back to 2003, when she first began funding Rep. Jan Schakowsky’s campaign.
