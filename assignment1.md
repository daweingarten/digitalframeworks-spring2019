# Assignment 1


## **Story Idea #1-_Immigration as a global issue._** 
Much of the news focus in the United States has been on immigration to the United States from Central America through Mexico. I would like to compare the data on how many people the United States returns to their home country to how many people the countries in the European Union return to their home country. This comparison could be a good reference point for American readers to start thinking of immigration in a global context. The question is: Is the European Union as a whole more accepting of immigrants than the United States?

## **Story Idea #2-_Refugees in the United States._** 
Over the past three decades, the amount of refugees that the United States has taken in has gone from over 200,000 a year to less than 25,000. I would like to compare this data of declining acceptance in the U.S. to the world’s need for refuge for displaced persons. I hope to be able to answer whether the increasing need is causing the declining acceptance in the U.S. Or if the declining acceptance in the U.S. is independent of the need. It would also be interesting to look at the data across presidential administrations to see if political party of the president has anything to do with the number of refugees accepted. Seeing where the refugees end up in the United States is also a question I would like to answer.  

## **Story Critique #1**
([Migration in Bulgaria]( https://www.intellinews.com/bulgaria-s-working-age-population-contracts-sharply-in-2018-159594/)) 

###  Clarity and accuracy

_**Clarity**_

2. The story is about people leaving Bulgaria, but the headline would seem to indicate otherwise. 

3. Navigating the data was not easy. Having three shades of blue did not make the data “pop.” The data was not always contained in the map. A chart or a graph would have been easier to read such as this:

  **Migration to Bulgaria,** 
  **Countries by percentage**
  
**1. Turkey |29% 
  1. Russia |11% 
  1. Germany| 7%**
  
_**Accuracy**_
5. I don’t question the accuracy of the data. I also do not know enough about Bulgaria to think otherwise. The reporters do list the source as the National Statistical Institute and link to their source and everything is explained.  

###  Quality

3. Using the map to show where the migrants left from is a good idea, if you are in Bulgaria. I am more interested in the country as a whole, not the specific regions in Bulgaria. 
The story did present and compare the data, but it was not organized and correlated. I like how the reporters broke down the data in words, but additional graphics could have been helpful. 

###  Type and color

2. I would have considered using a different color than blue. I would have also varied the colors to show a starker contrast on the map.  The font of the text also was not my favorite. 

###  Creativity

2. The story was not well done. There were no graphics. The map is not as meaningful without the photograph. The most important data for my purposes was not in the graphic. 


## **Story Critique #2**
([A snapshot of where migrants go after release into the United States](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2019/04/13/snapshot-where-migrants-go-after-release-into-united-states/?utm_term=.755e6c95bd3b)) 

###  Clarity and accuracy

_**Clarity**_
5. I knew this story would be about where migrants were going based off of what the headline is. 

3. Navigating the data was not easy. I knew the bigger circles meant more migrants, but the scale was not readily apparent. In reading the story, the data set is rather small comparatively, only composing 2 percent of migrants from the month or 1,545 people. I would put that fact in the lead to the story because otherwise the map is misleading.

_**Accuracy**_
5. I don’t question the accuracy of the data. It makes sense that more migrants would go to the larger cities. These cities like New York have pull factors like family ties and job opportunities. The reporters do list the source as the Annunciation House in the caption of their photograph and everything is explained.  

###  Quality

3. Using the map to show where the migrants went was a good, quality idea. I might have considered using different colors to represent the scale. The circles don’t do a good job of communicating how many people are going to each place where as color coding markings would be clearer. 
The story did present, compare, organize, and correlate the data. I like how the reporters broke down the maps into the country of origin. This was interesting. I might have had them in a clickable fashion, so you could see the maps one after another instead of having to scroll down. 

###  Type and color

4. It looked like the type fonts and colors belonged together, but I would consider using different colors to show the amount of migrants. Another thought is to have different colors represent the different countries of origin. 

###  Creativity

4. The story was well done. I might have had the photograph of the migrant children a little higher up, just to humanize the story earlier. The map is not as meaningful without the photograph. It had important graphics, showing each of the destinations for the migrants from predominately three countries.
