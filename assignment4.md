# Final Story Pitch

### What data source(s) you plan on using (though you can always add more later)

I plan on using https://explorer.usaid.gov/cd/SLV, https://explorer.usaid.gov/cd/HND, https://explorer.usaid.gov/cd/NIC, and https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ 

### Some sources you can talk to about the data or to get anecdotes from it
I can talk to EADS@usaid.gov for more info on the data as they are the ones who compiled it.  I can also talk to American embassies in those countries for anecdotes.
I can talk to Jon E. Piechowski, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs of the US Department of State or some of the legislators involved in the decision making process. These legislators would also be good to talk to about the lagtime around the aid that is given. 

### What elements in the data might be good candidates to visualize
I can discuss what the data is being used for in each of those countries. I can also aggregate the data into different categories such as governmental partners and nongovernmental partners. 
While correlation does not always mean causation, I think showing the data trends would be useful for the public to see. 

### What your news hook is - why is this timely?
This is timely because there are calls coming from the President of the United States to cut foreign aid. It is useful to know where the “aid” data goes, knowing that most of it is spent internally. Two senators just attended an event on "Promoting Economic Growth in the Northern Triangle: A Practical Approach" last week at the Atlantic Council.  

### What question will you answer with your data, and why is it newsworthy?
I will answer how the U.S. is spending their money in the Northern Triangle countries and what effect aid money has on curbing emigration from those countries. This is newsworthy because the number of children emigrating from the Northern Triangle countries is becoming an issue for both the U.S. and Mexico. This project will not answer all th questions about the effects of aid on migration, but it will show the last few years and be a guide for future work on the topic.
